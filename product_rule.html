    <h1>Product Rule</h1>
    <p>Kyle wants to buy coffee and a doughnut. The local doughnut shop has five kinds of doughnuts for sale and sells four varieties of coffee in three sizes (as in Example 2.1.1). How many different orders could Kyle make?
<br/>
<br/>
        Solution
        
        A natural way to divide Kyle's options into two aspects that can vary is to consider separately his choice of doughnut, and his choice of coffee. There are five choices for the kind of doughnut he orders, so  n1=5
         . For choosing the coffee, we have already used the product rule in Example 2.1.1 to determine that the number of coffee options is  n2=12
         .
        
        Thus the total number of different orders Kyle could make is  n1n2=5â‹…12=60
         .</p>
